# Alzheimer's Disease Analysis Using Regression Models

## Introduction
This graduate project focuses on utilizing regression models for the analysis and prediction of factors influencing Alzheimer's Disease. As part of my academic endeavor, this study aims to explore the application of data science and statistical analysis in the medical field, particularly in understanding and predicting complex diseases.

## Background and Objective
Alzheimer's Disease, a prevalent and complex neurodegenerative condition, presents significant challenges in medical research. This project employs various regression models to unveil key factors influencing the disease's progression, offering new insights for future medical studies.

## Methodology
The study involves the application of several statistical methods, including linear regression and logistic regression, to analyze data on Alzheimer's patients sourced from public databases. These models assess the impact of various biomarkers, clinical features, and patient background variables on disease progression.

## Results
Preliminary findings indicate significant correlations between certain biomarkers and clinical features with the progression of Alzheimer's Disease. These insights are crucial for understanding the disease mechanism and developing future treatment strategies.

## Future Directions
Building on the outcomes of this study, I plan to delve deeper into more sophisticated data analysis techniques and apply these to broader medical datasets to enhance our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.
